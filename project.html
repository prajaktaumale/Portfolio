            <h3>Topic: "Planer Object Detection Using Sift And Surf In Image Processing"</h3>
            <h4>Description: : In this project, using feature extraction, an initial set of raw data is divided and
                reduced to more manageable groups.The feature detection algorithm is compared by taking one image of
                different condition like scale, rotate, etc. Then the feature description regions are picked around key
                points and distinctive feature. For image matching, extracted features from feature detection step can
                provide reliable matching of different images. finally using these all method the desired object is
                detected in the scene
